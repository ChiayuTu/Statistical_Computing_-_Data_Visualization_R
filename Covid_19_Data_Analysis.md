## Background and Data for this assignment

Although by this point some of you may be avoiding the information overload surrounding Covid-19, understanding what has happened up to now by direct exploration of the latest data directly from the source, and extracting oneâ€™s own conclusions can be empowering.

At this point of the term you have an R toolbox broad enough to tackle the massive amount of data found in Johns Hopkins COVID-19 repository (click here). These data has been updated daily since the COVID-19 pandemic started. I also included links to other supplementary data sets to potentially explore the effectiveness of measures taken throughout the pandemic, including-mask use and vaccination. The datasets included are:

1. covid.ts.cases: daily time series for the confirmed number of COVID-19 cases at the county level for the US (file description here).

2. covid.ts.deaths: daily time series for the confirmed number of COVID-19 deaths at the county level for the US (file description here).

3. covid.usa.daily: COVID-19 USA daily state reports with the number of confirmed cases between April 14th and May 7th (file description here).

4. Vaccination data: state level COVID-19 daily vaccination numbers time series data from the Johns Hopkins University repository (file description here, )

5. State policy data: data files (one file by state) about dates and description of policies going into/out of effect. To load data for a particular state go to this link, find the name of the state file you want to work with. For example if you want to load data from California, use
