## Objective for this assignment
1. Upload csv files into R

2. Become proficient at manipulating, filtering, summarizing, cleaning, recoding, combining, etc. data in R using dplyr, tidyr, and purr

3. Use exploratory data analysis tools, such as summary statistics tables and figures to determine if a hypothesis has any merit

4. Create informative summary tables and figures

5. Use tools to extract information from character strings

## Background and Data for this assignment

Although by this point some of you may be avoiding the information overload surrounding Covid-19, understanding what has happened up to now by direct exploration of the latest data directly from the source, and extracting oneâ€™s own conclusions can be empowering.

At this point of the term you have an R toolbox broad enough to tackle the massive amount of data found in Johns Hopkins COVID-19 repository (click here). These data has been updated daily since the COVID-19 pandemic started. I also included links to other supplementary data sets to potentially explore the effectiveness of measures taken throughout the pandemic, including-mask use and vaccination. The datasets included are:

1. covid.ts.cases: daily time series for the confirmed number of COVID-19 cases at the county level for the US (file description here).

2. covid.ts.deaths: daily time series for the confirmed number of COVID-19 deaths at the county level for the US (file description here).

3. covid.usa.daily: COVID-19 USA daily state reports with the number of confirmed cases between April 14th and May 7th (file description here).

4. Vaccination data: state level COVID-19 daily vaccination numbers time series data from the Johns Hopkins University repository (file description here, )

5. State policy data: data files (one file by state) about dates and description of policies going into/out of effect. To load data for a particular state go to this link, find the name of the state file you want to work with. For example if you want to load data from California, use
```
policytrackerCA <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/govex/COVID-19/govex_data/data_tables/policy_data/table_data/Current/California_policy.csv")
```
To change the state you just need to replace the name of the state in the file name (e.g., California_policy.csv by Oregon_policy.csv) at the end of the link above for the one you want to work with.

Here is the data:
```
#confirmed COVID-19 time series cases US (trimmed to include from 01/01/2021 to 05/23/2022)
covid.usa.ts.confirmed <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv') %>%  select(UID:Combined_Key,`1/1/21`:`5/23/22`)

#Confirmed COVID-19 time series deaths US (trimmed to include from 01/01/2021 to 05/23/2022) these data include the population by county
covid.usa.ts.deaths <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv') %>%
  select(UID:Population,`1/1/21`:`5/23/22`)

#Daily data summary by state for 05-23-20222
covid.usa.daily <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us/05-23-2022.csv") 

#US vaccinated people data
vacc.people <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/govex/COVID-19/master/data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data/time_series/people_vaccinated_us_timeline.csv")


#uncomment to load policy tracker data for a state
#data on policy adoption by state (there is one file by state).  If loading data in CA, use:
#policytrackerCA <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/govex/COVID-19/govex_data/data_tables/policy_data/table_data/Current/California_policy.csv")
#If loading data in OR, use:
#policytrackerOR <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/govex/COVID-19/govex_data/data_tables/policy_data/table_data/Current/Oregon_policy.csv")
```
